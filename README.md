# Police-Fatalities-and-Socioeconomic-Factors-Analysis
This project analyzes data on police fatalities in the United States and explores potential relationships with various socioeconomic factors.

## Datasets Used
- Deaths by Police in the US
- Percentage of People Below Poverty Level
- Percentage of People Over 25 Who Completed High School
- Median Household Income (2015)
- Share of Race by City

## Key Findings
- Poverty rates vary significantly across US states, with Florida having the highest and Pennsylvania the lowest.
- There's an inverse relationship between poverty rates and high school graduation rates.
- Racial makeup of states varies widely, with some states showing much higher diversity than others.
- The majority of people killed by police were armed, with guns being the most common weapon.
- About 17.75% of people killed by police were under 25 years old.
- There are notable differences in the age distribution of fatalities across different races.
- Approximately 24.97% of people killed by police showed signs of mental illness.
- Police killings are not evenly distributed across cities, with some cities having significantly higher numbers.
- There are racial disparities in police killings, both in overall numbers and when adjusted for population.
- The number of police killings has shown some variation over time, but without a clear long-term trend.

## Visualizations
The analysis includes various visualizations:
- Bar charts of poverty rates and high school graduation rates by state
- Scatter plots and regression analysis of poverty vs. high school graduation rates
- Stacked bar charts of racial makeup by state
- Pie charts of fatalities by race and armed status
- Histograms and KDE plots of age distribution of fatalities
- Choropleth maps of police killings by state

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for static visualizations
- Plotly for interactive charts

## Future Work
Potential areas for further investigation include:
- Deeper analysis of the relationship between socioeconomic factors and police killings
- Examination of policy changes and their impact on fatality rates
- Investigation of regional and local factors influencing police use of force
